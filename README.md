SkillSync: End-to-End Developer Survey Insights

Collected and integrated ~10,000+ responses from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey and other sources to analyze technology trends, programming languages, and tool usage across industries.

Applied data wrangling techniques to clean, merge, and standardize datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy) and handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries and Python to identify top programming languages (e.g. Python, JavaScript), databases (e.g. MySQL), and IDEs by frequency and region.

Created over 15+ visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and scatter plots) using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to identify patterns and communicate findings.

Built an interactive dashboard using Google Looker Studio to present trends in technology skills, filterable by language, region, and job role.

Demonstrated proficiency in data storytelling by designing a slide-based final report in Canva/PowerPoint to present insights and recommendations to stakeholders.

Utilized tools like Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, and SQL for analysis, and followed best practices in reproducibility and documentation.

Showcased skills in ETL processes, data visualization, trend analysis, survey data analysis, and business intelligence reporting.
